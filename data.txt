Your own mix will need to be a non peat based compost, one part course sand - 2 parts soil.", "Fertilizer:": "From April - August I would use a weak liquid feed diluted only.", "Re-Potting:": "Repot every two years or when the current pot becomes too small. Only move to a pot slightly bigger and use a shallow container because of the small root system. Also make sure the pot has decent drainage holes.", "Humidity:": "Normal house humidity is fine. Open windows and doors to provide enough air within the room.", "Propagation:": "One method is to remove pups (offsets) by hand that are attached to the parent plant. Great if you find roots attached because they will begin growing quickly. If there are no roots I would pot up the plant after two days to allow the wound to begin to heal then place in moist soil. After planting offsets I would water once (just to make the soil moist \u2013 not wet) then wait to see a slight bit of new growth before watering again and keep the plant away from direct sunlight until this new growth has appeared.

A small amount of morning or evening sun won't harm, but midday sun could scorch the leaves and harm the plant. South, east or west facing areas are best suited and check if the plant needs to sit further back from the window.", "Watering:": "Overwatering is the worst offender for most Peperomias including this species. This is because of its succulent nature and small roots . Allow the soil to become dry then water thoroughly. During the winter reduce watering to a minimum. Better too little than too much.", "Soil:": "A peat based soil is best used that drains well. 2 parts peat and 1 part perlite or sand is a good mix. Other mixes will work well, but the main point is for the medium to drain well and be well aerated.", "Re-Potting:": "The trailing jade rarely requires repotting. A soil or top soil change is a good idea once a year but only repot when the existing pot is much too small. Remember the roots are very small which makes it easy for the soil to become waterlogged and will harm the plant.", "Fertilizer:": "During spring - while the plant is growing use a diluted liquid fertilizer once every 2 weeks, and once a month during summer. No feeding is required from autumn to spring", "Humidity:": "During the summer mist the leaves. As the plant does prefer high humidity, grouping it together with other plants is a good idea. This will increase humidity within the area. If dry air problems occur - make efforts to improve the humidity, but most will be fine with normal indoor humidity levels.", "Propagation:": "Stem tip and leaf cuttings can both be propagated. Take a few centimeters of stem tip with one or two healthy leaves attached and allow the tip or leaves 'if taking leaf cuttings' to dry out for a day, and then plant them in moist peat based potting mix.

You can replace the top soil once very spring.", "Fertilizer:": "During the spring while the plant is growing use a diluted liquid fertilizer once every 2 - 4 weeks  until the end of summer.", "Humidity:": "Average indoor humidity should be fine. You can mist the leaves every now and again during summer months if the air becomes dry.

Propagate with a couple of inches of leaves, letting the wound heal for a couple of days before planting (let them dry out). They also produce pups (offsets) that can be removed from the mother plant and replanted. Either method you should water the soil once and then wait to see a small sign of new growth to prevent killing them with overwatering."}}
